The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Website is dynamic. It can be viewed finely with all mobile devices
* [X] Images are dynamic. They change size accordingly.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  The biggest challenge in working on MakeReddit is the scale of the project.
  Despite it being a small project, the project felt overwhelming since there
  was a lot of cover and implement. There were many portions that were glanced
  over leaving some gaps in knowing what the code does. It was helpful to
  understand the REST convention to organize files.
